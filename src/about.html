    <p>I've always felt it in my fingers and in my toes that I can paint. I had had this feeling for several years and
      one fine day I decided to start. Surprisingly I've chosen expressionism to be my core style which is eventually
      the best medium to transfer my ideas and philosophies to the canvas. My journey started like Marco Polo's When
      I left my country at the age of seven. Wandering around different parts of the world I was actually learning
      about different cultures and art. Every stone, pebble and flower inspired me.</p>
    <h2>My Work</h2>
    <p>
      I consider myself a divine artist, most of the paintings are not planned the way they appear now as final a
      rtworks. There are many which are buried under them because some canvases are used several times. The faces
      appear unintentionally most of the time in my paintings and many ideas and concepts are simultaneously running in
      my mind when I start a new artwork. Sometimes I could finish a painting in an hour or two and sometimes it takes
      several hours and days. I start with one concept and end up doing a totally different one. The process takes me into
      a sort of trance, I am usually in a state of passion where thoughts and ideas melt within my soul and transform into
      figures and shapes. This state of transformation is so out of control that most of the times I leave the brush and start
      painting with my hands.

    <p>
      Most of my paintings address social issues like starvation, alcoholism or anguish of wars.I also try to bring harmony
      depicting nature, glimpses of natural elements in a minimalistic style. There is so much beauty in this world, we
      just need to open our internal eyes to it. Like a famous writer once expressed "the seeing people don't see".
    </p>
    <p>
      If I need to describe my work in one line I would say that "I unintentionally peek into my subconscious to
      transfer the divine messages on the canvas."
    </p>
    <h2>My Message</h2>
    <p>
      My message is mostly for the young people because they are the future. That's why in most of my paintings i
      address social issues related to the youth like abortion, alcoholism, poverty, socialism and war. My works
      are constant reminders to everyone to wake up and fight against the system of oppression, the media deceptions
      and lies which we face everyday. We need to wake up and wake others too against the unjust and cruel ruling elite
      of the world which is using every single mean to manipulate us for their agenda. I think it's high time for us to
      stand up against the injustice done to humanity for decades and make this world a better place to live in harmony,
      love and peace.
